New - work in progress
A simple common library for esp8266 and esp32 projects. 
reused many open source libraries - thanks

see esp_deviceFramework2 which contains configurable, 3 time period/day scheduler for automated actions. 

This library supports:

* OTA upgrades
* Set up of wifi configuration (connect, reconnect, ....)
* mqtt broker configuration (Connect, reconnect, lwt, .... )
* double reset detection to trigger above configuration
* telnet interface for debug and reporting
* NTP setup
* user exit extension support
* CSV formatted logging (logs can be output to MQTT, Telnet, Serial)

I can see loads of improvements needed and future ideas but i use with openhab just fine.
