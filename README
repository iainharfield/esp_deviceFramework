# A common library for esp8266 and esp32 projects. 

Reused many open source libraries - thanks

## This library supports:

- OTA upgrades
- Set up of wifi configuration (connect, reconnect, ....)
- mqtt broker configuration (Connect, reconnect, lwt, .... )
- Configurable, 3 time period/day scheduler for time of day actions actions
- Double Reset Detection to trigger above configuration
- Telnet interface for debug and reporting
- NTP setup
- User exit extension support
- CSV formatted logging (logs can be output to MQTT, Telnet, Serial)

I can see loads of improvements needed and future ideas but i use with openhab just fine.
